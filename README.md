The first main.c file will have code that can take the analog input from a resistor and thermistor voltage divider and then output that data to the user. 

The second main.c file will have code that can do the same thing as the previous code as well as take another analog input from a resistor and photocell voltage divider. 

Both of the schematics for these circuit are listed in the lab submission and the code has more comments going into greater detail about how the code functions.
